## Mastering AI System Design

This is the repository for [Mastering AI System Design](https://orangeava.com/products/mastering-ai-system-design), published by Orange AVA™

## About the Book
System design is now a critical skill for AI professionals, enabling them to integrate data pipelines, model serving, orchestration, and monitoring into cohesive production ecosystems. Mastering AI System Design will guide you through that complete journey—from understanding design principles and data workflows to building deployable AI architectures. It introduces core components of AI system design such as data engineering, model selection, evaluation metrics, API integration, and lifecycle management. 

Each chapter blends theory, architecture diagrams, and code-driven blueprints that cover real-world use cases—LLMs and prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fine-tuning, supervised and unsupervised learning systems, recommendation engines, edge AI deployment, and multimodal transformers.

By the end, you will be well-equipped to analyze trade-offs, design scalable inference pipelines, ensure model reliability, and apply system design frameworks for interviews and enterprise AI applications with confidence.

So, start building the future of virtualization—one cluster at a time.
 
## What you will learn
● Build end-to-end AI systems using proven frameworks for both interviews and real-world projects.

● Design and implement LLM architectures, RAG pipelines, and fine-tuned models with hands-on guidance.

● Develop supervised, unsupervised, recommendations, and multimodal AI systems across industries.

● Architect domain-specific LLMs, sequence-to-sequence models, and edge-optimized vision systems.

● Optimize, evaluate, and monitor AI systems for scalability, reliability, and performance.

● Leverage modern AI tools and libraries including LangChain, Hugging Face, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.
